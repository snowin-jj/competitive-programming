# Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

**Example 1:**

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Functionality:**

- The `isPalindrome` function correctly determines whether a given number `num` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backwards as forwards.
- It handles both positive and negative numbers, correctly identifying palindromes like 121, 0, and -101.

**Performance:**

- The approach using `toString()`, `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of digits in `num`. This is generally efficient for most number sizes.
- However, there's an alternative that's potentially faster on large numbers, discussed below.

**Best Practices:**

- The code is concise and uses a reasonable approach.
- Comments could be added to explain the purpose of the function and the logic behind it.

**Code Quality:**

- Consider adding comments to enhance clarity.
- Using a more descriptive variable name like `numberToEvaluate` instead of `num` could improve readability.

**Alternative Solution:**

While your solution is efficient, here's another approach without converting the number to a string, potentially improving performance for very large numbers:

```javascript
function isPalindrome(num) {
  if (num < 0 || (num % 10 === 0 && num !== 0)) {
    // Handle negative numbers and 0
    return false;
  }

  let reversed = 0;
  while (num > reversed) {
    reversed = reversed * 10 + (num % 10);
    num = Math.floor(num / 10);
  }

  return reversed === num || reversed === Math.floor(num / 10); // Handle odd palindrome lengths
}
```

**Key improvements:**

- Avoids string conversion, potentially faster for large numbers.
- Handles edge cases like negative numbers and 0 correctly.
- Uses integer operations for efficiency.

| Feature        | Original Solution                        | Alternative Solution                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Functionality  | Correctly identifies palindromes         | Correctly identifies palindromes              |
| Performance    | O(n) (number of digits)                  | O(n) potentially faster for large numbers     |
| Best Practices | Concise, reasonable approach             | Could benefit from comments                   |
| Code Quality   | Concise, lacks comments                  | Could benefit from comments and better naming |
| Readability    | Straightforward but not self-explanatory | Less readable due to loop and conditionals    |

**Conclusion:**

Both solutions are valid and achieve the desired functionality. Choose the one that best suits your requirements:

- If readability and simplicity are priorities, the original solution is good.
- If performance for very large numbers is critical, consider the alternative.

Always consider edge cases and best practices when writing code.
