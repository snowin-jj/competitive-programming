# Coding Kata:

This folder contains coding challenges and solutions to help you improve your programming skills. Each folder in this repo represents a different coding topic.

## How to use:

1. Browse the folders and identify a problem you want to work on. In the `README` you can find the instructions and coding challenges.
2. Try solving the coding challenges on your own first before looking at the solutions. The solutions are hidden by default in collapsed sections, so feel free to open the respective folders without worrying about spoilers.
3. If you get stuck, expand the collapsed sections in the solution files to reveal the answers. Study the solutions to learn how to solve similar problems.
4. Optionally, after solving a challenge on your own, compare your solution to the one provided. See if you can learn better approaches from the given solution.
5. Submit a PR if you come up with an alternative solution to a problem that you think others can learn from. Share your knowledge!
6. Still have questions? Open an issue, and I'll try to provide guidance.

Check back soon as more topics and challenges are added!
