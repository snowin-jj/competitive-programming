# Adding Big Numbers

Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers. The input numbers are strings and the function must return a string.

**Example:**

```
add("123", "321"); -> "444"
add("11", "99"); -> "110"
```

**Notes:**

- The input numbers are big.
- The input is a string of only digits
- The numbers are positives

To be honest, I have cheated ğŸ˜…. I need to study in depth the built-in functions.And how they work.
