# Primes in numbers

Given a positive number n > 1 find the prime factor decomposition of n. The result will be a string with the following form :

```
"(p1**n1)(p2**n2)...(pk**nk)"
```

with the `p(i)` in increasing order and `n(i)` empty if `n(i)` is 1.

**Example:**

n = 86240 should return "(2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)"

```javascript
function primeFactors(num) {
  const factors = {};
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
    // Start from 2 to avoid even factors
    while (num % i === 0) {
      // if it is present prevValue+1 or 0+1
      factors[i] = (factors[i] || 0) + 1;
      num /= i;
    }
  }
  if (num > 1) {
    // Handle remaining prime factor (if num is prime)
    factors[num] = 1;
  }
  return factors;
}

function primesinNumbers(n) {
  const factors = primeFactors(n);
  const decomposition = primeFactorDecomposition(factors); // Check if there are multiple factors before adding opening parenthesis

  return factors.length > 1 ? `(${decomposition})` : decomposition;
}

function primeFactorDecomposition(factors) {
  let result = "";
  for (const [prime, count] of Object.entries(factors)) {
    result += `(${prime}${count > 1 ? `**${count}` : ""})`;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log("prime factors 10: ", primeFactors(10));

console.log(primesinNumbers(86240)); // Output: (2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)
```

# AI's Review

## Overall:

The code is well-structured, readable, and mostly follows good practices. Here's a detailed breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

- Clear function separation: Separate functions for different tasks (prime factorization, decomposition, formatting) enhance maintainability.

- Comments: Comments explain the purpose of each function and code sections.

- Handles even numbers efficiently: Starts iterating from 2, avoiding unnecessary checks.
  Prime handling: Accounts for single prime factors if num is prime itself.

**Areas for improvement:**

- Redundancy: primeFactorDecomposition is a simple concatenation that could be done within primesinNumbers.

- Performance: For very large numbers, checking divisibility up to the square root might be insufficient. Using more efficient primality testing algorithms (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes) would improve performance for extremely large inputs.

- Edge case handling: The code assumes positive input and might misbehave for non-positive numbers.

**Improved Code:**

```javascript
function primesinNumbers(num) {
  if (num <= 1) {
    return ""; // Handle non-positive input
  }

  const factors = {};
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
    while (num % i === 0) {
      factors[i] = (factors[i] || 0) + 1;
      num /= i;
    }
  }

  if (num > 1) {
    // Handle remaining prime factor (if num is prime)
    factors[num] = 1;
  }

  let result = "";
  for (const [prime, count] of Object.entries(factors)) {
    result += `(${prime}${count > 1 ? `**${count}` : ""})`;
  }
  return result;
}
```

**Changes:**

- Combined primesinNumbers and primeFactorDecomposition within primeFactors.

- Added check for non-positive inputs.

- Updated loop condition to check up to the square root for better performance.

**Note:** This is a basic improvement suggestion. Depending on your specific needs and expected input ranges, further optimizations might be possible.
