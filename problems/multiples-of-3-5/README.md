# Sum of Multiples of Three and Five

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the
multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 3; i < number; i += 3) {
    if (i % 5 !== 0) sum += i;
  }
  for (let i = 5; i < number; i += 5) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}

# Chat GPT's Review

## Performance and Runtime:

The time complexity of your solution is O(n), where n is the value of the input number.

For very large input numbers, this can result in a large number of iterations, leading to higher time complexity and potentially slower performance.

## Improvements Needed:

**Optimize Loop:** Instead of iterating over all numbers below the given number, iterate only over the multiples of 3 and 5 and sum them directly. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.

**Input Validation:** The function currently returns 0 for negative input, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, adding a comment or documentation to clarify this behavior would improve readability and understanding.

## Good Aspects:

**Readability:** The function is clear and easy to understand.

**Error Handling:** The function correctly handles negative input as specified in the problem statement.

## Improved Version:

  let sum = 0;

    if (i % 5 !== 0) sum += i;
  }
  for (let i = 5; i < number; i += 5) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

## Performance Comparison:

The improved version of the function optimizes the loop to iterate only over the multiples of 3 and 5, resulting in better performance compared to the original version.

The time complexity of your solution is O(n). The worst-case time complexity can be reduced to O(1)

## My thoughts

O(n) ==> O(1) ? ðŸ˜³

My bad!!!
